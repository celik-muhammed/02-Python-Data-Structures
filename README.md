Almost every program uses data. Organizing, managing and storing data is important as it enables easier access and efficient modifications. `Data Structures` allow you to store and manage your data.[^1]

Python has a number of `built-in` data structures:
- [x] Strings
- [x] Lists
- [x] Tuples
- [x] Sets
- [x] Dictionaries
- [x] User-Defined Data Structures
